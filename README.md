# ML Income Prediction Group Competition

The Machine Learning pipeline for the final solution was as follows:

Missing values: All the missing values were calculated using Median, Mode and sometime a new 'Unknown' variable was introduced.

Data Encoding: To encode the data we made use of Target Encoding, wherein the categorical values get replaced with the mean of the taget variable 

XGBoost Machine Learning model gave us the best results.
